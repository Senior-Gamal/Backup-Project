# Backup Manager

This repository contains a fresh Laravel project skeleton for managing backup configuration across multiple servers. The previous code was removed due to numerous errors. See `docs/specification.md` for the full functional specification.

This project targets shared hosting (cPanel) and does not require Node.js or npm.
