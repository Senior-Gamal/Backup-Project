# Backup Manager

This repository contains a Laravel-based system for organizing and scheduling server backups. The previous iteration was removed due to numerous errors, and this repo now serves as a fresh starting point.

The project is intended for deployment on shared hosting without Node.js, npm or Vite.

## Features
- Manage servers and backup servers
- Schedule internal and external backups
- Assign backup servers
- Track backup configuration per server
- Manage licenses and groups
- Role based access (admin, manager, viewer)
- Basic list views for servers, backup servers, backups, licenses, groups, and users
