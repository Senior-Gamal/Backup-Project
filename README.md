# Backup Manager

Backup Manager is an organizational tool built in Laravel for scheduling and managing backup configurations across multiple servers. The system is intended for shared hosting environments (cPanel) and does not execute actual backup operations.

This project ships with precompiled frontend assets, so Node.js or npm is not required for setup.
## Features

- Schedule internal, external, database, and NAS backups
- Assign backup servers and track backup settings for each server
- Group licenses and associate them with servers
- Role-based access control (admin, manager, viewer, custom roles)
- Assign users to specific servers or clients
- Highlight conflicting backup times to avoid scheduling conflicts
- Dashboard with statistics and upcoming backup indicators
